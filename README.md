# Lean React App

A simple and lean React template.

Inspired in [Nano-React-App](https://github.com/adrianmcli/nano-react-app)

Try by running this in the terminal:

```
npx lean-react-app my-app
```


If you just want to download template without installing packages:

```
npx lean-react-app my-app -n
```
